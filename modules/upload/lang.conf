Uploaded images can have multiple thumbnails generated during the upload process.

When submitting this page in that circumstance it might take a while for it to reload because it has to process all existing images.</p><p>You can manually insert images into your post by entering the template tag provided after upload, or by copying that tag into your link_summary.tpl template and adding a $ after the curly bracket. An example of this would be 	<span class='label'>{$image1}</span>.</p>"
