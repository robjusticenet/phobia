<h2>CAPTCHA Module</h2>
<p>CAPTCHAs are a technology developed to prevent automated bots from submitting forms automatically on your website. They operate by challenging the user by having them either type in a set of words or characters, or provide an answer to some type of question. Kliqqi's CAPTCHA module has the ability to require users to enter a CAPTCHA answer whenever a user tries to submit a story, submit a comment, or register a new account. You can configure when CAPTCHAs should be displayed from the CAPTCHA settings page. You can also choose from one of four CAPTCHA methods: Solve Media, ReCAPTCHA, Whitehat, and Math.</p>

<h3>Solve Media</h3>
<p><a href="http://solvemedia.com/">Solve Media</a> provides one of the most secure CAPTCHA methods available through advanced tracking that detects possible spam bots and reacts by presenting them with more difficult CAPTCHAs. Another benefit to Solve Media is the ability to sign up for their revenue sharing program. By default Kliqqi uses it's own API key, so any revenue gained without changing the API key is being contributed to the Kliqqi project.</p>

<h3>ReCAPTCHA</h3>
<p>The new reCAPTCHA is here. A significant number of your users can now attest they are human without having to solve a CAPTCHA. Instead with just a single click they’ll confirm they are not a robot. We’re calling it the No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA experience. See blog for more details.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a> is a free service to protect your website from spam and abuse. reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive CAPTCHAs to keep automated software from engaging in abusive activities on your site. It does this while letting your valid users pass through with ease.<p>
<p>reCAPTCHA offers more than just spam protection. Every time our CAPTCHAs are solved, that human effort helps digitize text, annotate images, and build machine learning datasets. This in turn helps preserve books, improve maps, and solve hard AI problems.</p>

<h3>Whitehat</h3>
<p>Whitehat uses your own server to generate CAPTCHA images. It is seen as less effective at fighting spam bots due to the more legibile letters than what ReCAPTCHA provides.</p>

<h3>Math</h3>
<p>The Match CAPTCHA method presents users with an elementary level math equation that they must solve.</p>
